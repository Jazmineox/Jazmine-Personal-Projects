### Hey hey! I'm Jazmine! 👋🏾


💻 I am a creative technologist. I am really interested in web development, Data Analytics, program management, and so much more.

🎨 I like to work in the intersection of art and technology! There is so many practical skills you learn in the creative process (even coding is creative in a way), and I plan on using the creative process in my work to leave a positive impact on the world!
